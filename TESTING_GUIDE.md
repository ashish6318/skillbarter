## üìπ **SINGLE-DEVICE VIDEO FEATURES TESTING**

### üéØ Overview
Testing video features on a single device during development requires multiple browser tabs/windows to simulate different users. Here's how to thoroughly test the Jitsi Meet integration:

### üîß Pre-Testing Setup for Video Features

#### 1. Ensure Jitsi External API is Loaded
First, verify that the Jitsi Meet External API is properly loaded:

```html
<!-- This should be in your index.html -->
<script src="https://meet.jit.si/external_api.js"></script>
```

#### 2. Browser Requirements
- **Chrome/Chromium** (Recommended for best video support)
- **Firefox** (Good alternative)
- **Edge** (Also works well)
- Avoid Safari for development testing (limited WebRTC support)

#### 3. Camera/Microphone Permissions
- Allow camera and microphone access when prompted
- Test with different permission states

---

### üé≠ Single-Device Testing Strategy

#### Method 1: Multiple Browser Windows
1. **Open 2 different browsers** (e.g., Chrome + Firefox)
2. **Login as different users** in each browser:
   - Browser 1: Login as Teacher (User A)
   - Browser 2: Login as Student (User B)

#### Method 2: Incognito/Private Windows
1. **Use same browser with incognito mode**:
   - Regular window: Login as Teacher
   - Incognito window: Login as Student

#### Method 3: Multiple Browser Tabs (Advanced)
1. **Use Chrome's user profiles**:
   - Create different Chrome profiles
   - Each profile maintains separate sessions
