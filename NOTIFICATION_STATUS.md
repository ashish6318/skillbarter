## 🔧 How It Works

### Backend Socket Events
The server emits these socket events:
```javascript
// Session request
io.emit('sessionRequest', { sessionId, student, skill, ... })

// Session acceptance (NEW)
io.emit('sessionAccepted', { sessionId, teacherName, creditsDeducted, ... })

// Credit deduction
io.emit('creditDeduction', { sessionId, creditsDeducted, remainingCredits, ... })

// Session status updates
io.emit('sessionStatusUpdate', { status, sessionId, skill, ... })

// Join ready
io.emit('sessionJoinReady', { sessionId, skill, scheduledFor, ... })
```

### Frontend Socket Listeners
The `SocketContext` listens for all events and routes them to the notification manager:
```javascript
newSocket.on('sessionRequest', (data) => {
  window.addSessionNotification({ type: 'session_request', ...data })
})

newSocket.on('sessionAccepted', (data) => {
  window.addSessionNotification({ type: 'session_accepted', ...data })
})
// ... etc for all notification types
```

### Notification Manager
The `SessionNotificationManager` component:
- Handles all notification types with appropriate styling
- Shows toast notifications as backup
- Auto-dismisses non-critical notifications
- Provides action buttons for interactive notifications

## 🎯 Testing Notifications

### Manual Testing Flow:
1. **Create two test accounts** (Teacher and Student)
2. **Request Session** (as Student) → Teacher gets notification with Accept/Reject
3. **Accept Session** (as Teacher) → Student gets acceptance notification + credit deduction
4. **Wait for Reminders** → Both get join-ready notifications 15min before
5. **Cancel Session** → Other party gets cancellation notification

### Browser Console Monitoring:
Open browser console to see notification events:
```
📋 Session request received: {...}
✅ Session accepted notification: {...}
💳 Credit deduction notification: {...}
🎥 Session join ready notification: {...}
```
